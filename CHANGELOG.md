## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-24

### Added
- 🌐 **Multi-interface support** for multi-homed systems
  - New command-line option: `--interface <name>` to bind to specific network interface (e.g., eth0, eno1, enp6s0)
  - New command-line option: `--bind-ip <address>` to bind to specific IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.10)
  - Essential for 3-tier architecture configurations with separate control and audio networks
  - Fixes SSDP discovery issues on systems with multiple network interfaces (VPN, multiple NICs, bridged networks)
  - Auto-detection remains default behavior for single-interface systems (backward compatible)
  
- **Advanced Configuration with command-line Parameters**
  - ### Basic Options

```bash
--name, -n <name>       Renderer name (default: Diretta Renderer)
--port, -p <port>       UPnP port (default: auto)
--buffer, -b <seconds>  Buffer size in seconds (default: 2.0)
--target, -t <index>    Select Diretta target by index (1, 2, 3...)
--no-gapless            Disable gapless playback
--verbose               Enable verbose debug output
```
 - ### Advanced Diretta SDK Options
Fine-tune the Diretta protocol behavior for optimal performance such as Thread-mode, transfer timing....

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed format change freeze when transitioning between bit depths
  - **Issue**: Playlist playback would freeze for 10 seconds when switching between 24-bit and 16-bit tracks
  - **Root cause**: 4 residual samples in Diretta SDK buffer never drained, causing timeout
  - **Solution**: Implemented force flush with silence padding to push incomplete frames through pipeline
  - **Result**: Format changes now complete in ~200-300ms instead of 10-second timeout
  - **Impact**: Smooth playlist playback with mixed formats (16-bit/24-bit/32-bit)
- Improved error recovery during format transitions
- Better handling of incomplete audio frames at track boundaries

### Changed
- **UPnP Initialization**: Now uses `UpnpInit2()` with interface parameter for precise network binding
- **Format Change Timeout**: Reduced from 10s to 3s for faster error recovery
- **Buffer Drain Logic**: Added tolerance for ≤4 residual samples (considered "empty enough")
- **Hardware Stabilization**: Increased from 200ms to 300ms for better reliability during format changes
- **Logging**: Enhanced debug output during format change sequence with flush detection

### Configuration
- **Systemd**: New `NETWORK_INTERFACE` parameter in `/opt/diretta-renderer-upnp/diretta-renderer.conf`
  ```bash
  # For 3-tier architecture
  NETWORK_INTERFACE="eth0"      # Interface connected to control points
  
  # Or by IP address
  NETWORK_INTERFACE="192.168.1.10"
  ```
- **Wrapper Script**: Automatically detects whether parameter is IP address or interface name

### Use Cases

#### Multi-Interface Scenarios
1. **3-tier Architecture** (recommended by dsnyder):
   - Control Points (JPlay, Roon) on 192.168.1.x via eth0
   - Diretta DAC on 192.168.2.x via eth1
   ```bash
   sudo ./bin/DirettaRendererUPnP --interface eth0 --target 1
   ```

2. **VPN + Local Network**:
   - Local network on 192.168.1.x via eth0
   - VPN on 10.0.0.x via tun0
   ```bash
   sudo ./bin/DirettaRendererUPnP --bind-ip 192.168.1.10 --target 1
   ```

3. **Multiple Ethernet Adapters**:
   - Specify which adapter handles UPnP discovery
   ```bash
   sudo ./bin/DirettaRendererUPnP --interface eno1 --target 1
   ```

#### Format Change Improvements
- **Mixed Format Playlists**: Seamless transitions between 16-bit, 24-bit, and different sample rates
- **Streaming Services**: Better compatibility with services like Qobuz that mix bit depths
- **Gapless Playback**: Maintains gapless behavior even during format changes

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive **Multi-Homed Systems** section in README
- Added troubleshooting guide for network interface selection
- Added examples for common multi-interface configurations
- Updated systemd configuration guide
- Added FORMAT_CHANGE_FIX.md technical documentation

### Technical Details

#### Multi-Interface Implementation
- Modified `UPnPDevice.cpp`: `UpnpInit2(interfaceName, port)` instead of `UpnpInit2(nullptr, port)`
- Added `networkInterface` parameter to `UPnPDevice::Config` structure
- Propagated interface selection from command-line → DirettaRenderer → UPnPDevice
- Enhanced error messages when binding fails (suggests `ip link show`, permissions check)

#### Format Change Fix Implementation
- Added **Step 1.5** in `changeFormat()`: Force flush with 128 samples of silence padding
  - Pushes incomplete frames through Diretta SDK pipeline
  - Only triggered when residual < 64 samples detected
- Modified drain logic to accept small residual (≤4 samples) as successful
- Implemented `sendAudio()` function for unified audio data transmission
- Better synchronization between AudioEngine and DirettaOutput during transitions

### Breaking Changes
None - all changes are backward compatible

### Migration Guide
No migration needed. Existing configurations continue to work:
- Systems with single network interface: No changes required
- Multi-interface systems: Add `--interface` or configure `NETWORK_INTERFACE` in systemd

### Known Issues
- None reported

- ✅ Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 (x64)
- ✅ AudioLinux (x64)

- ✅ 3-tier architecture with Intel i225 + RTL8125 NICs
- ✅ Mixed format playlists (16/24-bit, 44.1/96/192kHz)
- ✅ Qobuz streaming (16/24-bit)
- ✅ Local FLAC/WAV files
- ✅ DSD64/128/256 playback
